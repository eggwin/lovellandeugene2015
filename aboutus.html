			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Eugene &amp; Lovell met each other working together for the same company. After several happy hours, they got to know each other, but it wasn't such a smooth ride in the beginning...</p>

			<h1>His Story</h1>
			<p>After a series of phone and personal interviews, I put in my notice at my previous job...and waited. For so long. It took 6 weeks to finally be hired, and the whole time, while I was reading the email exchanges between my recruiter and the company, I found this peculiar name plastered on all of them: "Lovell."</p>
			<p>I thought, "was this the person who was responsible for delaying my employment? How hard is it to get approval for a signature?"</p>
			<p>When I arrived at my first day of work, I had already lost 6 weeks of pay as a result of the delays, so I wasn't in the mood for pleasantries. I shook her hand, but I brushed her off. I was in a bad mood!</p>
			<p>After a few months, the company had a halloween party, which gave us the opportunity to be reacquainted through our coworkers. I discovered during this party what her dietary restrictions were.</p>
			<p>Later, I was able to find a vegetarian, gluten-free sandwich served from a food truck that would stop by occasionally. I would buy one for Lovell once in a while because I knew that she liked them.</p>

			<h1>Her Story</h1>
			<p>He didn't even look at me when we first met. Because of our initial meeting, I didn't even bother to learn his name and forgot it over time.</p>
